### Configs ‚öôÔ∏è

In my plugin there is only the `config.yml` in which you can set something.There is also the 
`spawn.yml`, which is only used to secure the position of the spawn. Important 
settings such as messages are set here.

**Note**: If something breaks in the config.yml, you can simply delete it and restart the
plugin (with `/ls reload`). Afterwards everything should work as usual again.

### Permissions ‚úñÔ∏è

The permissions allow or prohibit someone from using a specific command. To set this you can use a 
plugin like `LuckPerms`. 

This is a list of all the permissions that exist in my plugin LemonSpawn:

Permission            | What the permission does
                     -|-
`lemonspawn.reload`   | Allows someone to reload the plugin
`lemonspawn.spawn`    | Allows someone to teleport to the spawn
